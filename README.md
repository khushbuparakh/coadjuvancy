# coadjuvancy
================
It's a wild life conservation application.
One way to crowd-source conservation is through mobile phone applications. The purpose of the app is for people to be able to identify and report wildlife trafficking incidents worldwide. The app currently operates in English. It is build for country governments in order to help support and empower wildlife-trafficking law enforcement officers in the region. Reports by app users will be analysed by a Wildlife Crime Data Analyst and over time, the information will help build data and enrich understanding of illegal wildlife trade across the region, help prioritise response action and highlight areas in need of increased enforcement resources.
